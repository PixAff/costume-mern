- Add roles in scope of uniqueness 
- refetch roles in transferlist after creating new role
- sometimes scriptnumber gets lost when creating a role in Modal 
    - precise: the population of script does not work - scene gets passed only with script as id
    - reason: script gets only populated when fetching all scenes!
